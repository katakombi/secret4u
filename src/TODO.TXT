* Redesign sqlite table: replace 'read' column by an 'access-time' column
* Implement a 30days expiration functionality
* Redesign all functions to be more flexible/reusable by 
  - using more params
  - including them as external js files
* Replace text fields by something more sophisticated (rich-text, image uploads, etc)
* Kick out unneccessary elements (e.g. key fields, encrypted text fields)
* Do a lot of testing on the email client invocation mechanism:
  - Does it work everywhere?
  - Can it work without opening a blank tab/window?
* Analyze drawbacks of the approach:
  - Cross-site scripting?
  - Man-in-the-middle attack?
  - ...?
* UI overhaul: orientate at pastebin maybe? Most importantly, we need bigger message window
